### PREAMBLE

Welcome to the second part of this tutorial on technical writing. If you're joining for the first time, you can find the first part here.
In the previous chapter, you learnt what technical writing is, its importance and who a technical writer is. In this chapter you get to learn prerequisites for becoming a technical writer and how to get started on your technical writing journey. Excited? Let's get into it.

### CHAPTER TWO

Now you've gone through the first chapter and you're feeling pretty confident about your chances in the technical writing space. Great!
In this chapter, firstly you'll learn about three essential prerequisites, to be successful as a technical writer.

#### PREREQUISITE ONE: WRITING SKILLS

To be successful as a technical writer, you must possess at least above average writing skills. Technical writing as the name implies is mostly writing. You don't need to be an expert writer to get started but you do need to possess basic writing skills. You must understand grammar, paragraphs, sentence structure, and the likes to get started as a technical writer. I've dedicated a chapter to this topic. By the end of this tutorial you'll have the necessary writing skills to get started on your technical writing journey.

#### PREREQUISITE TWO: RESEARCH SKILLS

Technical writing is educative writing about technology. Technical writing is wide just as technology is wide. In your technical writing journey, it's very possible for you to encounter a situation where you're asked to write a thousand words about a topic you're just hearing of for the first time. Your research skills come in handy at this juncture.
What do I mean by research skills. By research skills, I'm referring to your ability to scour the internet for relevant information about your topic. To be a good researcher, you must be able to skim through lots of web pages in order to extract the value you need to present to your readers.
To be a good technical writer, you must be commited to a life of constant learning and writing. As a freelance technical writer, you can get contracts to write on topics along any spectrum of technology. The only way to survive as a technical writer is to hone your research skills to the maximum and be willing at all times to learn.

#### PREREQUISITE THREE: TECH INCLINED (or TECHIE for short)

The third prerequisite goes without saying. To be a successful technical writer, you need to be a techie. The essential third skill you need to get started on your technical writing career is not so much of a skill but more of a lifestyle.
Your definition of techie could be different from mine. That's okay! Technical writers come in all shapes and breeds. As you start out on your technical writing career, one essential skill that'll help you throughout your journey is your innate ability to be tech inclined.

Now you know. You know what it takes to be successful as a technical writer, what do you do next?

But before then I'll leave you with this; As a technical writer, especially one just starting out, you can easily find topics to write about as long as you keep on learning. I call this teach as you learn.
