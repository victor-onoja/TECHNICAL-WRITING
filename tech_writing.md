The most important transitions in technical writing are as follows:

however
therefore
for example

The most important conjunctions are as follows:

and
but
or

When writing or editing, learn to recognize terms that might be unfamiliar to some or all of your target audience. When you spot such a term, take one of the following two tactics:

If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation. (Don't reinvent the wheel.)
If your document is introducing the term, define the term. If your document is introducing many terms, collect the definitions into a glossary.

This document is for engineers who are new to the Telekinetic Tactile Network (TTN) or need to understand how to order TTN replacement parts through finger motions.

Protocol Buffers (or protobufs for short) provide their own definition language. Blah, blah, blah. And that's why protobufs have won so many county fairs.

Here are the guidelines for acronyms:

Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
The acronym appears many times in the document.

Consider the following pronoun guidelines:

Only use a pronoun after you've introduced the noun; never use the pronoun before you've introduced the noun.
Place the pronoun as close as possible to the referring noun. In general, if more than five words separate your noun from your pronoun, consider repeating the noun instead of using the pronoun.
If you introduce a second noun between your noun and your pronoun, reuse your noun instead of using a pronoun.

Use either of the following tactics to clarify ambiguous uses of this and that:

Replace this or that with the appropriate noun.
Place a noun immediately after this or that.

The following pronouns cause the most confusion in technical documentation:

it
they, them, and their

To engage and educate readers, choose precise, strong, specific verbs. Reduce imprecise, weak, or generic verbs, such as the following:

forms of be: is, are, am, was, were, etc.
occur
happen

Sentences that start with There is or There are marry a generic noun to a generic verb. Generic weddings bore readers. Show true love for your readers by providing a real subject and a real verb.

Don't confuse educating your readers (technical writing) with publicizing or selling a product (marketing writing).

Focus each sentence on a single idea, thought, or concept.

When you see the conjunction or in a long sentence, consider refactoring that sentence into a bulleted list. When you see an embedded list of items or tasks within a long sentence, consider refactoring that sentence into a bulleted or numbered list.

The following list (by no means complete) shows common words that introduce subordinate clauses:
which
that
because
whose
until
unless
since

Do the subordinate clauses in a sentence extend the single idea or do they branch off into a separate idea? If the latter, consider dividing the offending subordinate clause(s) into separate sentences.

In the United States, reserve which for nonessential subordinate clauses, and use that for an essential subordinate clause that the sentence can't live without.

If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use which. If you don't hear a pause, use that. Go back and read the preceding two example sentences. Do you hear the pause in the first sentence?

Place a comma before which; do not place a comma before that.

What separates effective lists from defective lists? Effective lists are parallel; defective lists tend to be nonparallel.

Consider starting all items in a numbered list with an imperative verb. An imperative verb is a command, such as open or start

If the list item is a sentence, use sentence capitalization and punctuation. Otherwise, do not use sentence capitalization and punctuation.

Consider the following guidelines when creating tables:

Label each column with a meaningful header. Don't make readers guess what each column holds.
Avoid putting too much text into a table cell. If a table cell holds more than two sentences, ask yourself whether that information belongs in some other format.
Although different columns can hold different types of data, strive for parallelism within individual columns. For instance, the cells within a particular table column should not be a mixture of numerical data and famous circus performers.

We recommend introducing each list and table with a sentence that tells readers what the list or table represents. In other words, give the list or table context. Terminate the introductory sentence with a colon rather than a period.

Although not a requirement, we recommend putting the word following into the introductory sentence. For example, consider the following introductory sentences:

The following list identifies key performance parameters:

Take the following steps to install the Frambus package:

The following table summarizes our product's features against our key competitors' features:

The work of writing is simply this: untangling the dependencies among the parts of a topic, and presenting those parts in a logical stream that enables the reader to understand you.

The opening sentence is the most important sentence of any paragraph. Busy readers focus on opening sentences and sometimes skip over subsequent sentences. Therefore, focus your writing energy on opening sentences.

Good opening sentences establish the paragraph's central point.

A paragraph should represent an independent unit of logic. Restrict each paragraph to the current topic. Don't describe what will happen in a future topic or what happened in a past topic. When revising, ruthlessly delete (or move to another paragraph) any sentence that doesn't directly relate to the current topic.

// The opening sentence defines the central point of the paragraph. Each sentence in the paragraph must be about the central point. //

Readers generally welcome paragraphs containing three to five sentences, but will avoid paragraphs containing more than about seven sentences.

Good paragraphs answer the following three questions:

What are you trying to tell your reader?
Why is it important for the reader to know this?
How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?

good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience needs to do a task − your audience's current knowledge and skills

In other words, make sure your document provides the information that your audience needs but doesn't already have. Therefore, this unit explains how to do the following:

Define your audience.
Determine what your audience needs to learn.
Fit documentation to your audience.

As a guideline, insert a comma wherever a reader would naturally pause somewhere within a sentence.

use commas to separate items in an embedded list

In sentences that express a condition, place a comma between the condition and the consequence.

You can also wedge a quick definition or digression between a pair of commas

avoid using a comma to paste together two independent thoughts

A period separates distinct thoughts; a semicolon unites highly related thoughts.
